# Goblin-Caravan
 A build for my game goblin caravan where you lead a Caravan of Goblins through different hazards and enemies. (Check the readme for controls.)
Look man(or Woman(or even person(maybe even therian))) 
I spent a whole week working on the goblin code and like less days on the other stuff
All I ask is that if you use my code then you gimme at least a little bit of credit
That being said here's the controls:


Try to guide the goblins with a mouse cursor. 

E to spawn in more goblins

WASD to move your camera

Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out

Shift to move camera faster

R to reset the scene

Esc quits the game
